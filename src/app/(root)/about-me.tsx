        During my first semester at university, I&apos;ve been introduced to
        basics of HTML and CSS, which have allowed me to make my first website.
        Since then I&apos;ve known that web development is something I&apos;d
        like to do in the future. As a person that pays a lot of attention to
        details, I find writing code that gives you instantaneous feedback about
        the look and layout of the thing you&apos;re creating very satisfying
        and rewarding.

        Soon after that I also dipped my toes into the world of backend and
        infrastructure, which allowed me to get a better understanding of how
        the web works. As I&apos;ve grown as a developer, I&apos;ve worked
        alongside senior developers who have raised my standard for what&apos;s
        expected of any web application.
